TROUBLESHOOTING DEPLOYMENT
=========================

If the iframe video appears in Localhost but NOT in your deployed site:

1. DATA MISSING (Most Likely)
   - Did you edit the article in the *Localhost* Admin (`http://localhost:5173/nucleus/admin`)?
   - You MUST also edit the article in your *Production* Admin (`https://daivanlabs.com/nucleus/admin`) and paste the Drive Code again.
   - The database content might not be synced between local and prod if they are different, or if you just haven't entered the data in the live version yet.

2. BROWSER CACHE
   - Hard refresh your production site (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R).

3. RESPONSIVENESS
   - I have updated the code to use `aspect-video` (16:9 ratio) so it scales perfectly on Mobile and iPad.
